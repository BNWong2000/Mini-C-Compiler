# Language Specification

### Types

##### Basic Data Types
```
int (32 bits)
char (8 bits)
float (32 bits)
double (64 bits)
void
```

##### Derived Data Types
```
struct
union
array
```

### Operators
```
{ } [ ] ( ) 
+ - * / % & | ^ << >>
++ -- 
! ~ && || == != < > <= >= 
= += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=
, . -> : ; 
```

### Features
Here is a rough overview of the features I intend on supporting with this language.
- Pointers and Arrays
    - and thus, C-style strings
- Structures
- Unions
- Functions
- Integer and Floating Point Arithmetic
- Logical operations
    - Short circuiting
- Loops and Decision Structures
- Strong type checking
- Single Line Comments





Standard was based off a subset of the C language.
